Recent studies have shown that T1 plays a global role not only in T2 but also in the T3 (Jofuku et al., 1994, 2005; Okamuro et al., 1997; Ohto et al., 2005).
Recent studies have shown that T1 plays a global role not only in T2 but also in the control of T4 mass (Jofuku et al., 1994, 2005; Okamuro et al., 1997; Ohto et al., 2005).
In addition, T5 expression is controlled transcriptionally and translationally in a co-ordinated manner.
In particular, T6 are thought to target T7 and its homologs, thereby inhibiting the translation process (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003; Chen, 2004).
In particular, T6 are thought to target mRNAs of T8 and its homologs, thereby inhibiting the translation process (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003; Chen, 2004).
However, the transcriptional regulation of T9 has not been well understood (Okamuro et al., 1997).
The current study showed that T10 activity repressed T11, T12 and T10 expression.
This is consistent with previous results showing that T14 regulates its own T14 expression (Okamuro et al., 1997; Chen, 2004) as well as other genes, such as the T16 genes.
In addition, T17 increased the expression level of T19.
In addition, over-expression of T18 increased the expression level of T19.
T20 is a transcriptional activator interacting with T21, an T23-responsive element (Büttner and Singh, 1997).
T20 is a transcriptional activator interacting with T21, an T22 (Büttner and Singh, 1997).
Although the T24 up-regulated T26 and T27 expression, these promoters (∼2·0 kb upstream from ATG) did not contain the T28.
Although the over-expression of T25 up-regulated T26 and T27 expression, these promoters (∼2·0 kb upstream from ATG) did not contain the T28.
Interestingly, analysis of T29 T30 T31 interacting with T32 revealed that T31 bound to promoters in the absence of T32 (Chakravarthy et al., 2003).
Like T35, transcriptional regulation of the target genes of T36 may be complex.
Down-regulation of T37 was observed in T38.
The T39 resulted in a complete T41, suggesting that T43 is essential in the T44.
The null mutation of T40 resulted in a complete T41, suggesting that T40 is essential in the T44.
The T39 resulted in a complete loss of responsiveness to T42, suggesting that T43 is essential in the T42 signal pathway.
The T39 resulted in a complete T41, suggesting that T43 is essential in the T45 signal pathway.
However, T46 expression was not induced by T48 treatment or in T49, indicating that T50 is a receiver for various signals.
However, T46 expression was not induced by T47 or in T49, indicating that T50 is a receiver for various signals.
It is known that T51 receives not only T52 but also other T52, such as T54 and T55 (Alonso et al., 1999).
It is known that T51 receives not only T52 but also other signals, such as T54 and T55 (Alonso et al., 1999).
The T56 is thought to be necessary for T58.
The N-terminal of T57 is thought to be necessary for T58.
The T56 is thought to be necessary for T59 responsiveness.
On the other hand, the T60 is required for transducing the signal to the downstream components (Wang et al., 2002).
On the other hand, the C-terminal of T61 is required for transducing the signal to the downstream components (Wang et al., 2002).
Our observations suggested that the T62 expression was induced via T63 but not by the T64 (Fig. 7).
Our observations suggested that the T62 expression was induced via T63 but not by the T65 signal (Fig. 7).
