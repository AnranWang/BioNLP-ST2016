T1 Possesses a T2 Characteristic of Transcription Factors.
Our findings that the T3 gene encodes a T5 protein (Fig. 3) and is expressed primarily during T6 (Fig. 4) suggest that it, like T7 and T8, is a transcriptional regulator of T10 development.

The T11 is an ≈120-amino acid residue region defined originally as the T12, which shares the largest contiguous block of sequence identity with its ortholog, T15 T16 (10).
The T11 is an ≈120-amino acid residue region defined originally as the third basic region of T13 T14, which shares the largest contiguous block of sequence identity with its ortholog, T15 T16 (10).
Subsequently, this domain was identified in other T17 proteins, such as T18 (34) and T19 (32).
Subsequently, this domain was identified in other T17 proteins, such as T18 (34) and RELATED TO T20/T21 (32).
Many proteins containing T22, including T23/T24, T25, and T26, function as transcription factors (20, 33, 34).
The T27 is responsible, at least in part, for the DNA-binding activity of T28/T29 and RELATED TO T28/T29 (32, 37, 38).
The T27 is responsible, at least in part, for the DNA-binding activity of T28/T29 and RELATED TO T28/T29 (32, 37, 38).
To our knowledge, the T33 is unique to T34.
Maximum parsimony analysis (39) of the T35 of 48 predicted T36 proteins suggests that T37, T38, and T39 constitute one class, perhaps indicating their common origin (S.L.S. and J.J.H., unpublished results).
All three genes are expressed primarily during T40 and are required genetically for the T41.
All three genes are expressed primarily during T40 and are required genetically for the completion of normal T43 development.
Although they all play roles in T45 development, their specific functions have diverged.
Although they all play roles in T44, their specific functions have diverged.
T46 is a transcription factor that operates primarily during the T47, whereas T48 and T49 are T50 proteins required for processes during both the T51 and T47s.
