Similar to T8 T9, the T10 provide a microenvironment, the T11, in which T12 is repressed, whereas daughter cells that leave this site undergo differentiation.
In the T13 T14, the T15 are located in the three outermost cell layers of the most T16.
In the T13 T14, the T15 are located in the three outermost cell layers of the most central region of the T17.
The T18 cannot be distinguished by their appearance from the surrounding meriT18, and T20 function can only be unambiguously identified by clonal studies (Stewart and Dermen, 1970).
Expression of T21 (T22) T23(Fletcher et al., 1999) that coincides with the presumed position of the T24 provides an operational marker for T25 identity in the T26.

Only a few mutants have been isolated that specifically T27.
Only a few mutants have been isolated that specifically fail to protect T28 from differentiation.
One of the genes identified from mutant studies encodes the homeodomain protein T29 (T30).
T31 is expressed in a domain underneath the T32 termed the T33 (T34) and is required and sufficient to maintain the overlying T32 undifferentiated (Mayer et al., 1998; Schoof et al., 2000).

The T37 in turn signal back via the T38 peptide to restrict the T39, thereby creating a negative feedback loop to dynamically T41 (Brand et al., 2000; Schoof et al., 2000).
The T37 in turn signal back via the T38 peptide to restrict the size of the T40, thereby creating a negative feedback loop to dynamically T41 (Brand et al., 2000; Schoof et al., 2000).
The T37 in turn signal back via the T38 peptide to restrict the T39, thereby creating a negative feedback loop to dynamically control the size of the T42 population (Brand et al., 2000; Schoof et al., 2000).
T43 presumably acts as an extracellular ligand of the T45 receptor kinase complex, which eventually leads to downregulation of T46 transcription in the recipient cells (Clark et al., 1997; Stone et al., 1998; Trotochaud et al., 1999; Rojo et al., 2002; Lenhard and Laux, 2003).

In T47 that are homologous to T48, the T49 (T50) gene represses T51 expression T52 to terminate the T54 after a limited number of T55 have been formed (Lenhard et al., 2001; Lohmann et al., 2001).
In T47 that are homologous to T48, the T49 (T50) gene represses T51 expression late in T53 development to terminate the T54 after a limited number of T55 have been formed (Lenhard et al., 2001; Lohmann et al., 2001).
The T56 is formed during T58 development (Barton and Poethig, 1993).
The T56 is formed during T57 (Barton and Poethig, 1993).
In T59, the onset of T60 expression in T61 suggests that T65 formation has been initiated already at this stage (Mayer et al., 1998).
In T59, the onset of T60 expression in precursor cells of the T62 in the T63 suggests that T65 formation has been initiated already at this stage (Mayer et al., 1998).
In T59, the onset of T60 expression in T61 suggests that T64 has been initiated already at this stage (Mayer et al., 1998).
T66 expression is detected from T67 on T68 the outgrowing T68 (Fletcher et al., 1999).
In T69, the T70 becomes visible as a bulge of small cytoplasmic cells that after T71 give rise to a T72 before an T73 is formed, carrying T74 with T75 and T76.
Many aspects of the mechanisms that operate in the T77 to T78 are not understood and might have escaped genetic analysis due to genetic redundancy.
Many aspects of the mechanisms that operate in the T77 to maintain T79 undifferentiated are not understood and might have escaped genetic analysis due to genetic redundancy.
Therefore, we performed an extensive genetic screen to detect presumably rare dominant-negative mutations affecting T80.
Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of the T81 mutant that in the homozygous state is unable to T83 similar to the T84 mutant.
Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of the semidominant T82 mutant that in the homozygous state is unable to T83 similar to the T84 mutant.
We show that the T85 in T88 mutants is caused by a T89 (T91) gene that was previously identified as one of the components of the ABC model in T92, where it represses T93 (Bowman et al., 1991; Drews et al., 1991), in T94 (Jofuku et al., 1994; Okamuro et al., 1997b), and in the T95 (Jofuku et al., 2005; Ohto et al., 2005).

We show that the T85 in T88 mutants is caused by a mutation in the T90 (T91) gene that was previously identified as one of the components of the ABC model in T92, where it represses T93 (Bowman et al., 1991; Drews et al., 1991), in T94 (Jofuku et al., 1994; Okamuro et al., 1997b), and in the T95 (Jofuku et al., 2005; Ohto et al., 2005).
In this article, we show that T96 in the T97 requires the activity of T98 and redundant factor(s) via an T99 independent mechanism that involves interaction with the T100-T101 feedback loop.
