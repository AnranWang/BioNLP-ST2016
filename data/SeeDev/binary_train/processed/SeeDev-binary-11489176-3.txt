The T1 (T3) loci of T4 have been shown to interact genetically in regulating processes such as T5 and T7-inducible gene expression.
The T2 insensitive (T3) loci of T4 have been shown to interact genetically in regulating processes such as T5 and T2-inducible gene expression.
The T1 (T3) loci of T4 have been shown to interact genetically in regulating processes such as T5 and T6.
To determine whether T8 or T9 can physically interact with themselves or any of the other T10, we tested pairwise combinations in T11 interaction assays.
The assay system was comprised of fusions between the T12 proteins and either the T13 or the transcription-activation domain T13.
The assay system was comprised of fusions between the T12 proteins and either the T13 or the T14.
Direct interaction of the T16 protein fusions would bring the T18 domains of the fusions into close enough proximity to transactivate a T19 controlled by a T18-responsive promoter (James et al., 1996).
Direct interaction of the T16 protein fusions would bring the T17 of the fusions into close enough proximity to transactivate a T19 controlled by a T21-responsive promoter (James et al., 1996).

The T22 (BD)-T22 construct encoded a slightly truncated form of T22 (amino acids 3–287) because a full-length T22 fusion provides very strong transcription-activation function in the absence of any T29 (AD) fusion (Söderman et al., 2000).
The T22 (BD)-T25 construct encoded a slightly truncated form of T25 (amino acids 3–287) because a full-length T25 fusion provides very strong transcription-activation function in the absence of any T29 (AD) fusion (Söderman et al., 2000).

Although the truncation reduces target gene expression roughly threefold, the remaining basal level of expression is still approximately tenfold higher than that produced by the T31-BD alone (Figure 1a).
Although the truncation reduces target gene expression roughly threefold, the remaining basal level of expression is still approximately tenfold higher than that produced by the T30 alone (Figure 1a).
The T32 construct encoded all but the first eight amino acids of T34, thus including all conserved domains, but produced a much lower basal expression of the reporter genes (only fourfold that produced by the vector control) (Figure 1b).
The BD-T33 construct encoded all but the first eight amino acids of T33, thus including all conserved domains, but produced a much lower basal expression of the reporter genes (only fourfold that produced by the vector control) (Figure 1b).
Combination of these T36-BD fusions with T36-AD fusions to full-length T39 produced a broad range of results (Figure 1).
Combination of these T35 fusions with T38-AD fusions to full-length T39 produced a broad range of results (Figure 1).
Combination of these T36-BD fusions with T36-AD fusions to full-length T39 produced a broad range of results (Figure 1).
T40 and T41 did not interact with either T41 or T43, but both T45 and T43 strongly interacted with T43.
T40 and T41 did not interact with either T41 or T43, but both T44 and T43 strongly interacted with T43.
