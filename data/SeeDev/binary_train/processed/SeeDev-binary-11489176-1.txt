Genetic and physiological studies have shown that the T1 T2 (T4) loci interact to regulate T6-specific and/or ABA-inducible T5.
Genetic and physiological studies have shown that the T1 T3-insensitive (T4) loci interact to regulate T6-specific and/or ABA-inducible T5.
Genetic and physiological studies have shown that the T1 T2 (T4) loci interact to regulate T5 and/or ABA-inducible T5.
Genetic and physiological studies have shown that the T1 T2 (T4) loci interact to regulate T6-specific and/or T8-inducible gene expression.
We have used the T9 assay to determine whether any of these genetic interactions reflect direct physical interactions.
By this criterion, only T10 and T11 physically interact with each other, and T11 can form homodimers.
The T13 of T14 is essential for this interaction; this is the first specific function ascribed to this domain of the T14/VP1 family.
The T13 of T14 is essential for this interaction; this is the first specific function ascribed to this domain of the T14/VP1 family.
The T13 of T14 is essential for this interaction; this is the first specific function ascribed to this domain of the T14/T18 family.
The T20 domains required for interaction with T21 include two conserved charged domains in the amino-terminal half of the protein.
The T19 required for interaction with T21 include two conserved charged domains in the amino-terminal half of the protein.
An additional conserved charged domain appears to have intrinsic transcription activation function in this assay.
T22 assays with a T23 reporter gene under control of the T24-abundant T26 promoter show that only T27 binds directly to this promoter fragment.
T22 assays with a T23 reporter gene under control of the T24-abundant T25 show that only T27 binds directly to this promoter fragment.
