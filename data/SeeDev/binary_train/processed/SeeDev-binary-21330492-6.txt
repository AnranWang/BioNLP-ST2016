Identification of Repressors of the T1 during T3 One lingering mystery has been the identity of the T4.
Identification of Repressors of the T2 Program during T3 One lingering mystery has been the identity of the T4.
Identification of Repressors of the T1 during T3 One lingering mystery has been the identity of the genes directly repressing the T5 program T6.
Our microarray analysis indicated that T7, T8/T9, and T10 were down-regulated in T11.
These genes have previously been shown to repress the transcription of the T12 genes and other maturation-related genes in T13.
Interestingly, several other T14 were down-regulated (T15, -T17, -T16, and T18) as well as the closest homolog to T19 (T20).

It has already been shown that T21 binds to a T22, which is present in both the T23 and T24, regulating the program at least at two levels (Gao et al., 2009).
It has already been shown that T21 binds to a T22, which is present in both the T24 of the LEC genes and T24, regulating the program at least at two levels (Gao et al., 2009).
It has already been shown that T21 binds to a T22, which is present in both the T23 and of the genes encoding T26, regulating the program at least at two levels (Gao et al., 2009).
We analyzed single and double mutant combinations of T27, T28, and T29 and found that these genes redundantly repress the T30 during T32, downstream of T33 targets.
We analyzed single and double mutant combinations of T27, T28, and T29 and found that these genes redundantly repress the T31 program during T32, downstream of T33 targets.
Thus, our studies demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that the same genetic mechanism negatively regulates T34 storage genes during T35 and T34ling development.
