Our data support the hypothesis that T1 encodes an enzyme involved in T2.
First, analysis of T3 T4 using antibodies and gas chromatography have demonstrated a significant reduction in RGI and its composite backbone monosaccharides Rha and GalUA in comparison with T6 seeds.

Second, cloning of T7 revealed a putative protein containing similarity to bacterial nucleotide sugar interconversion enzymes, suggesting that it, too, is required for the T8.
The T9 is most similar to T11 T12, the first of three enzymes required for the T13 (Tonetti et al., 1998).
The N-terminal portion of T10 is most similar to T11 T12, the first of three enzymes required for the T13 (Tonetti et al., 1998).
These data favor a role for T14 in the T15, a key step in the T16.
A reverse genetics approach taken by another group has come to a similar conclusion regarding the putative enzymatic function of T17 (also designated T18 [T19]; B. Usadel et al., 2004).
However, another role in T20 cannot be ruled out without evidence of enzymatic activity in the T21.
T22 such as T23 encode three separate enzymes (T24, T25, and T26) to T27 (Tonetti et al., 1998).
The putative T28 protein not only contains an T29 with similarity to the bacterial T30 but also a T31 with some similarity to T32 (this study; Reiter and Vanzin, 2001).
There is a precedent in T33 for a bifunctional T34 in the T37 (T38, T39) (Bonin and Reiter, 2000).
There is a precedent in T33 for a bifunctional T35, T36 in the T37 (T38, T39) (Bonin and Reiter, 2000).
Therefore, based on sequence analysis, it is attractive to postulate a single, multifunctional protein acting in the T40 in T41 (Reiter and Vanzin, 2001).
T42 is a member of a small gene family consisting of three genes (T43, T42/T45, and T46; Reiter and Vanzin, 2001) that exhibit high identity at both nucleotide and amino acid levels.
The ubiquitous expression of T47 and T48 can be postulated to provide a mechanism for the formation of the T49 in T51 mutants and the T52 present in T51 T54.
The ubiquitous expression of T47 and T48 can be postulated to provide a mechanism for the formation of the normal T50 in T51 mutants and the T52 present in T51 T54.
Redundancy in genes coding for putative T55 is unsurprising because of the importance of the Rha-containing pectins RGI and RGII in T56.
In fact, the presence of multiple genes coding enzymes involved in T57 is common in T58 (Reiter and Vanzin, 2001).
