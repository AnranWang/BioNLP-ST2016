T1 T2 exhibit T3 and T4 (Schwartz et al. 1994).
T1 T2 exhibit T3 and arrest at the T5 (Schwartz et al. 1994).
To identify the earliest T6 morphological defects, we systematically analyzed T6 T8 throughout T9.
Because T10 T11 are not viable, T11 from self-pollinated plants heterozygous for T10-5 and T10-10, two presumed null alleles (McElver et al. 2001; Schauer et al. 2002), were examined.

T16 developing within a T17 are approximately at the same developmental stage, which enabled an estimate of T18 embryonic stages based on the morphology of their T19 siblings.
It was reported previously that T20/T21 T22 exhibit T23 at the T24 beginning at the T25 and in the T26 beginning at the T27 (Schwartz et al. 1994).
Our morphological analysis of T28 T29 confirmed these findings and revealed previously unreported phenotypes (Fig. 1A).
We identified initial T30 in the T31 (i.e., the T32 most proximal to the T34 proper) of 19% (29 of 154) of T35 T34s from T37 (Fig. 1A).
We identified initial T30 in the T31 (i.e., the T32 most proximal to the T33) of 19% (29 of 154) of T35 T36 from T37 (Fig. 1A).
By the T38, T39 were observed in ∼25% of T40 from T41 (Fig. 1A).
These T42 with defects were presumably T43, and their defects included T44 as well as the previously unreported T45 (Fig. 1A).
These T42 with defects were presumably T43, and their defects included T44 as well as the previously unreported loss of periclinal subprotoderm cell divisions in the T47 proper (Fig. 1A).
In subsequent stages, these T48 did T50 and were T52 and T53 (Fig. 1A; Schwartz et al. 1994).
In subsequent stages, these abnormal T49 did T50 and were T52 and T53 (Fig. 1A; Schwartz et al. 1994).
In subsequent stages, these T48 did not produce T51 and were T52 and T53 (Fig. 1A; Schwartz et al. 1994).
Furthermore, T54 T55 could not be recovered from T56, which suggested that the developmentally T57 derived from T56 were indeed T60 (data not shown).
Furthermore, T54 T55 could not be recovered from T56, which suggested that the developmentally arrested T58 derived from T56 were indeed T60 (data not shown).
Because T61 from T62 and selfed dcl1-10/+ T62 exhibited the same T64 at indistinguishable frequencies, subsequent analyses focused on T61 from T62 T62 (Table 1; data not shown).
Because T61 from T62 and T63 exhibited the same T64 at indistinguishable frequencies, subsequent analyses focused on T61 from T62 plants (Table 1; data not shown).
T68 transcripts were detected by quantitative RT–PCT (qRT–PCR) in both T69 T70 from T71 and T69 T70 from T74 that developed normally, but were not detected in abnormal T69 T70 from T74 (Supplemental Fig. 1).
T67 were detected by quantitative RT–PCT (qRT–PCR) in both T69 T70 from T71 and T69 T70 from T74 that developed normally, but were not detected in abnormal T69 T70 from T74 (Supplemental Fig. 1).

These expression analyses further confirmed that T79 from T81 were T83.
These expression analyses further confirmed that abnormal T80 from T81 were T83.
These expression analyses further confirmed that T79 from selfed T82/+ plants were homozygous for T82-null alleles.
