Transcription of T1 T2 (MAT) genes is controlled by members of several transcription factor families, such as T4 (T5), T6, T7, and T8.
Transcription of T1 T3 maturation (MAT) genes is controlled by members of several transcription factor families, such as T4 (T5), T6, T7, and T8.
In this work, we identify T9 T10 as a novel transcriptional regulator of MAT genes. T10 expression in T12 precedes and overlaps that of its target genes.
Gain- and loss-of-function approaches indicate a correlation between the amount of T13 protein and MAT gene expression.
Specific T14 and T15 binding of T16 protein to a T17 element in the T18 is demonstrated.
Importantly, heterodimerization with T19 or T20, previously described T21 regulators of MAT gene expression, significantly enhances DNA binding activity and produces a synergistic increase in target gene activation.
Full-level target gene activation is strongly correlated with the ratio of the correspondent T22 heterodimerization partners.
Whereas T23 does not interact with T24, a crucial transcriptional regulator in T25 T26, ternary complex formation between the T27 heterodimers and T24 increases the expression of MAT genes T29.
We therefore propose that heterodimers containing T30 participate in enhanceosome formation to produce a dramatic increase in MAT gene transcription.
