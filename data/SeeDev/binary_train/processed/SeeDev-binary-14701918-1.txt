The T1 T2 undergoes a complex T3 that includes the T5 and secretion of large quantities T5, T7, and secondary cell wall T5.
The T1 T2 undergoes a complex process of T4 that includes the T5 and secretion of large quantities T5, T7, and secondary cell wall T5.
The T1 T2 undergoes a complex T3 that includes the T5 and T6 of large quantities T6, T7, and secondary cell wall T5.
T9 (T11) lead to a decrease in T12 and incomplete T14.
Mutations in T10 (T11) lead to a decrease in T12 and incomplete T14.
T9 (T11) lead to a decrease in T13 mucilage and incomplete T14.
We show that T15 encodes a putative T16, an enzyme required for the T17, the major component of T18 T19.
This result suggests that the T20 is a limiting factor in the T21.
This result suggests that the T20 is a limiting factor in the biosynthesis of pectinaceous T22 mucilage.
In addition, the reduced T23 observed in the absence of a key enzyme in T24 in T25 mutants establishes a causal link between T26 and T27.
The cellular phenotype seen in T28 mutants is similar to that of several transcription factors (T29 [T30], T31 [T32], T33 T34, and T35 [T36]).
Expression studies suggest that T37 is developmentally regulated in the T38 by T39, T40, and T41, whereas T42 and T43 appear to be regulating T44 through alternate pathway(s).
Our results provide a framework for the regulation of T45 and T47 differentiation.
Our results provide a framework for the regulation of T45 and T46.
