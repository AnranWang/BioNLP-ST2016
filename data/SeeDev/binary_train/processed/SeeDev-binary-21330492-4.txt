The key positive regulators of the T1 are the T3, probably assisted by several T5 and MYB T5 (Baud et al., 2008).
The key positive regulators of the T2 program are the T3, probably assisted by several T5 and MYB T5 (Baud et al., 2008).
The key positive regulators of the T1 are the T4 genes, probably assisted by several T5 and MYB T5 (Baud et al., 2008).
The key positive regulators of the T1 are the T3, probably assisted by several T5 and T6 (Baud et al., 2008).
All of these bind to the T8 T10 storage protein genes and T8 (Lara et al., 2003; Kagaya et al., 2005; Braybrook et al., 2006; Santos-Mendoza et al., 2008).
All of these bind to the T8 T10 storage protein genes and genes involved in the T11 (Lara et al., 2003; Kagaya et al., 2005; Braybrook et al., 2006; Santos-Mendoza et al., 2008).
All of these bind to the T8 T9 genes and T8 (Lara et al., 2003; Kagaya et al., 2005; Braybrook et al., 2006; Santos-Mendoza et al., 2008).
We found that several of these genes were up-regulated in the T12 mutant: T13, T14, T15, and several T16 and T17 (Table I).
In contrast, T18 was unaffected and T20 was down-regulated.
In contrast, T19 was unaffected and T20 was down-regulated.
We observed that in the T21, the T22 and T23 transcriptional reporter genes are excluded from the T24 T25, just T26.
In T27, they are expressed in the T28 at least by the T29, coinciding with the onset of T30 in the T31.
Our analysis of T32 and T33 double mutants confirms that both proteins are required for the T34 phenotype, further supporting their position downstream of T35.
