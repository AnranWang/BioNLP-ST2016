T1, a member of the core T3/T4 complex, was recovered as an T6-interacting protein.
T1, a member of the core T2, was recovered as an T6-interacting protein.
T1, a member of the core T3/T4 complex, was recovered as an T5.
The T8/T9 complex generally consists of eight proteins: T83, T91, T92, T13, T14, T15, T16 and T17.
The T7 generally consists of eight proteins: T10, T91, T92, T13, T14, T15, T16 and T17.
However, T18 has only one T19, and lacks the T20 (reviewed by Silverstein and Ekwall, 2005).
T21 has two T22 orthologs, T23 (T24) and T25 (T26), and the T21 ortholog of T29 has recently been shown to interact directly with T23 (Song and Galbraith, 2006).
T21 has two T22 orthologs, T23 (T24) and T25 (T26), and the T21 ortholog of T29 has recently been shown to interact directly with T23 (Song and Galbraith, 2006).
We show here that T31 is also able to interact with T32, and that T33 can directly interact with T34 (Figure 1).
Although the T35 alone is not sufficient to mediate an interaction between T36 and T37, it is necessary (FigureÂ 1).
