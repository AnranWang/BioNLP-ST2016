Co-ordinated regulation of gene expression is an essential biological event, especially when each transcriptional factor acts as a key regulator.
In T1, the T2 produces four concentric whorls of T3(T4, T5, T6 and T7).
T11ccording to the ‘T8’ model for the determination of T10 identity, T11 activity specifies T12, T11 and T14 activities lead to T15, T14 and T17 activities lead to T18, and T17 activity specifies T20 (Weigel and Meyerowitz, 1994).
T11ccording to the ‘T8’ model for the determination of T9, T11 activity specifies T12, T11 and T14 activities lead to T15, T14 and T17 activities lead to T18, and T17 activity specifies T20 (Weigel and Meyerowitz, 1994).
The T21 (T22) gene, which belongs to the T23, exhibits several characteristics distinct from other T24.
Although most T25 contain a T26, T27 contains two T30/ethylene-responsive element binding protein (T27/EREBP) T29 (Jofuku et al., 1994).
Although most T25 contain a T26, T27 contains two T28 (T27/EREBP) T29 (Jofuku et al., 1994).
Although most T25 contain a T26, T27 contains two T30/T31 (T27/EREBP) T33 (Jofuku et al., 1994).
Although most T25 contain a T26, T27 contains two T30/ethylene-responsive element binding protein (T27/EREBP) T29 (Jofuku et al., 1994).
Although most T25 contain a T26, T27 contains two T30/ethylene-responsive element binding protein (T27/T35) T29 (Jofuku et al., 1994).
The T37 transcript is not observed in a region-specific pattern in the T38, and is detected in other T40 (Jofuku et al., 1994; Okamuro et al., 1997).
The T36 is not observed in a region-specific pattern in the T38, and is detected in other T40 (Jofuku et al., 1994; Okamuro et al., 1997).
The T37 transcript is not observed in a region-specific pattern in the four wholes of T39, and is detected in other T40 (Jofuku et al., 1994; Okamuro et al., 1997).
Recent reports showed that T41 controlled T43 mass (Jofuku et al., 1994, 2005; Ohto et al., 2005) and that expression of the T41 protein was translationally regulated by the T45 (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003; Chen, 2004).
Recent reports showed that T41 controlled T42 (Jofuku et al., 1994, 2005; Ohto et al., 2005) and that expression of the T41 protein was translationally regulated by the T45 (Aukerman and Sakai, 2003; Chen, 2004).
Thus, T46 may play an important role in both T47 and whole-plant T47.
Thus, T46 may play an important role in both T47 and T48.
T49 belongs to the T49/T52 family, one of the largest groups of plant transcriptional factors (Riechmann et al., 2000).
T49 belongs to the T49/T52 family, one of the largest groups of plant transcriptional factors (Riechmann et al., 2000).
It is known that T53 suppresses expression of T54, the T55 gene of a floral homeotic gene (Drews et al., 1991; Bomblies et al., 1999).
In addition, T56 regulates the expression of T57 (T58) genes containing one T56/T61 domain (Okamuro et al., 1997).
In addition, T56 regulates the expression of T57 (T58) genes containing one T56/T61 domain (Okamuro et al., 1997).
However, the relationship of the transcriptional regulation between T62 and T63 genes is not fully understood.
Previously, we characterized T64 (T66), one of the T67 genes, as a transcriptional activator (Ogawa et al., 2005).
Previously, we characterized T65 ethylene-responsive element binding protein (T66), one of the T67 genes, as a transcriptional activator (Ogawa et al., 2005).
T68 is regulated by an T69 (Büttner and Singh, 1997; Ogawa et al., 2005).
T68 is regulated by an T70 signal (Büttner and Singh, 1997; Ogawa et al., 2005).
It was clarified that T71 is regulated by T72, but not T73, suggesting that T71 expression is independently regulated under T73 in T76.
It was clarified that T71 is regulated by T72, but not T73, suggesting that T71 expression is independently regulated under T73 in T77 signalling.
Interestingly, it was reported that T78 expression was regulated by T79 (Okamuro et al., 1997).
Nevertheless, relationships between T80 and T81 in T82 transduction have not been investigated in detail.
Nevertheless, relationships between T80 and T81 in T83 signal transduction have not been investigated in detail.
Here, we show that T84 regulates T85 genes such as T86 and AtT851, and the over-expression of T86 causes the accumulation of T84 transcripts.
