T1 (T3-like 15) is a member of the T4, a large, diverse family of regulatory factors.
T1 (T2) is a member of the T4, a large, diverse family of regulatory factors.
All of the members of this family contain a highly conserved 55– to 60–amino acid domain, known as the T5, which binds DNA through contacts in the minor groove and interactions with the phosphate backbone (Pellegrini et al. 1995).
T6 also have more divergent regions, which contribute to structural and functional specificity.
T7 are found in all T8 and play pivotal roles in regulating many different kinds of developmental events, including T9 in T10, T11 in T12 and T13, and T14 in T15.
T16 form a particularly large and diverse group in T17.
In addition to the T18, the T19 proteins have another, less highly conserved domain, the T20, which is thought to serve as a T21 (reviewed in Riechmann and Meyerowitz 1997).
The T22 consists of at least 36 members in T23 (Liljegren et al. 1998), including the well-known T25 identity regulators T26 (T27), T28 (T29), and T30; T32 identity regulators T33 (T34) and T35; T37 identity regulators T38/T27L8, T27L1, and T27L5; and a set of other T27L factors of unknown function expressed in T43.

Family members that are preferentially expressed in developmental contexts other than the T44 have also been identified (Rounsley et al. 1995) and include such factors as T45, which plays a role in control of T47 architecture in response to T48 (Zhang and Forde 1998), and T49, a recently identified repressor of T44ing (Michaels and Amasino 1999).

Based on its expression pattern and divergent sequence, T51 belongs to this latter group; however, its developmental role is undefined.
Our previous findings have led us to suggest that T52 is likely to play an important regulatory role at the T53.

We initially isolated T56 as a low-abundance T55 that preferentially accumulates in T57 (Heck et al. 1995); Rounsley et al. 1995 independently isolated it from a floral cDNA library.

T58 is a single-copy gene in T59, and thus far, genome sequencing efforts have not revealed any genes likely to represent recent duplications of the T58 locus.
The only members of the T61 in T62 that are known to be expressed in T63 are T64 and T65 (Flanagan and Ma 1994).
T66 shows strong preferential expression in T67, whereas T68 is predominantly expressed in T69 (Heck et al. 1995).
Using T70-specific antibodies, we have shown that T70 accumulates in the T72, T74, and T73 but only in the T80 of the T81 (Perry et al. 1996).
Using T70-specific antibodies, we have shown that T70 accumulates in the T73 young embryos, T74, and T73 but only in the T80 of the T81 (Perry et al. 1996).

More recently, we found that T82 is similarly regulated in a wide variety of embryogenic situations (Perry et al. 1999).
Although T83 accumulates preferentially in T84, its accumulation is clearly not restricted to the T85.
T87 transcripts have been detected in T88 by using in situ hybridization (Rounsley et al. 1995) and in various tissues (including T90) in T91 by using RNA gel blot analyses (Heck et al. 1995).
T86 have been detected in T88 by using in situ hybridization (Rounsley et al. 1995) and in various tissues (including T90) in T91 by using RNA gel blot analyses (Heck et al. 1995).
T87 transcripts have been detected in young T89 seedlings by using in situ hybridization (Rounsley et al. 1995) and in various tissues (including T90) in T91 by using RNA gel blot analyses (Heck et al. 1995).
These findings, plus an awareness that expression patterns have provided important insights into the developmental roles of T92 in past investigations, motivated us to look more closely at T93 expression in T94.
We combined an analysis of T96 promoter activity with an examination of mRNA and protein accumulation to examine both qualitative and quantitative aspects of T96 expression.
We combined an analysis of T95 activity with an examination of mRNA and protein accumulation to examine both qualitative and quantitative aspects of T97 expression.
Because the cellular localization of T98 is regulated in T99 (Perry et al. 1996 , Perry et al. 1999), we also performed immunolocalization analyses to determine whether the protein accumulated in the T100 or the T101.
Because we found that T102 accumulates transiently in T103 in a selected set of tissues during the T104 and reproductive T104, this raises the possibility that it plays multiple roles during the T106.

To investigate these roles, we have examined whether altering the expression pattern of T107 has any effect on T108.
The results were striking and unexpected.
The combination of effects on the T109, T110, and T111 defines a new kind of developmental role for a T112.
Specifically, T113 may play a role in controlling T114, particularly in T115.
