The T1 was a key innovation of T3 (Vicente-Carbajosa and Carbonero, 2005).
The T2 program was a key innovation of T3 (Vicente-Carbajosa and Carbonero, 2005).
The T1 was a key innovation of T4 plants (Vicente-Carbajosa and Carbonero, 2005).
Like any other important T5, this program is tightly regulated.
Several of the mechanisms involved in inducing T6 during T7 and repressing it T8 have been worked out (Baud et al., 2008; Santos-Mendoza et al., 2008; Zhang and Ogas, 2009).
However, other pieces of the puzzle are missing, in particular the T9.
However, other pieces of the puzzle are missing, in particular the genes that repress T10 during T11.
The data presented here strongly suggest that T12 are these key negative regulators of the T13.
The data presented here strongly suggest that T12 are these key negative regulators of the T14 program.
In T15 T16, we observed T17 and T21 starch grains, T20, and T21.
In T15 T16, we observed early chloroplast T18 and T21 starch grains, T20, and T21.
In T15 T16, we observed T17 and T21 starch grains, T20, and T24.
In T15 T16, we observed T17 and T21 T22, T23, and T21.
Our conclusion is reinforced by the transcriptional profile of T25 T26 T27, which resembles that of older T27.
Similarly, Nodine and Bartel (2010) described the T29 and a T32 in T33 T34.
Similarly, Nodine and Bartel (2010) described the early accumulation of T31 transcripts and a T32 in T33 T34.
Interestingly, even though the T35 starts too early, the timing of the different components of the program seems to be unaffected.
Interestingly, even though the T36 program starts too early, the timing of the different components of the program seems to be unaffected.
In particular, we still see accumulation of T37 preceding the expression of the T39 storage protein T40, as in T41 T42.
In particular, we still see accumulation of T37 preceding the expression of the T38 T40, as in T41 T42.
It is tempting to speculate that T43 regulate the T44, but not the progression, T44.
It is tempting to speculate that T43 regulate the T44, but not the T45, T45.
