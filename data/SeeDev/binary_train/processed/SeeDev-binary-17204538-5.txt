The translation of T2 mRNA is suppressed by T3 (Chen, 2004) and T2 protein down-regulates T2 and T6 expression (Okamuro et al., 1997; this study), as indicated in grey.
The translation of T1 is suppressed by T3 (Chen, 2004) and T4 protein down-regulates T4 and T6 expression (Okamuro et al., 1997; this study), as indicated in grey.
In the current study, it was demonstrated that T7 expression was regulated through T8 and T9, and that T8 may contribute to T11, as indicated by in black.
The T13 mRNA level did not change in the T14 mutant.
The T12 level did not change in the T14 mutant.
The position of T15 is a branch of the T16 under T18.
The position of T15 is a branch of the T17 signalling pathway under T18.
It is known that the T19 of ein3 mutants T19 is weaker than T21 mutants (Wang et al., 2002).
It is known that the T19 of T20 mutants to ethylene is weaker than T21 mutants (Wang et al., 2002).
Previous studies reported that both T22-dependent and independent pathways exist downstream of T23 (Binder et al., 2004; Seifert et al., 2004).
Furthermore, T24 expression is independently regulated under T25 in T26 (Ogawa et al., 2005; this study).
Furthermore, T24 expression is independently regulated under T25 in T27 signalling (Ogawa et al., 2005; this study).
In this study, T28 was not induced by T29 despite increasing expression of T30.
We suggest that these signal transductions compete with one another.
T32 knockout plants exhibited a T33.
T31 exhibited a T33.
T32 knockout plants exhibited a weak floral phenotype with a lower number of T34.
An evaluation was also made of T35 and T36 expression in T38 knockout plants having the same level of T39 (data not shown).
An evaluation was also made of T35 and T36 expression in T37 having the same level of T39 (data not shown).
The T40 mutants showed an T41 compared with the T43, and T44 mutants affect the T45 (Kieber et al., 1993).
The T40 mutants showed an earlier-maturing phenotype in the T42 compared with the T43, and T44 mutants affect the maturation of the T42 (Kieber et al., 1993).
The T40 mutants showed an T41 compared with the T43, and T44 mutants affect the maturation of the T46 (Kieber et al., 1993).
Interestingly, the T47 mutT47s show a similar phenotype to the T49 knockout plT47s (Elliott et al., 1996; Klucher et al., 1996).
Interestingly, the T47 mutT47s show a similar phenotype to the AtEBP knockout plT47s (Elliott et al., 1996; Klucher et al., 1996).
T50 is a member of the T52/T53 family containing the T52/T56 domains.
T50 is a member of the T51 containing the T55/T56 domains.
T50 is a member of the T52/T53 family containing the T52/T56 domains.
T57 caused up-regulation of T59 in T60.
Over-expression of T58 caused up-regulation of T59 in T60.
Despite the accumulation of T62 mRNA in T63, no T65 were observed.
Despite the accumulation of T61 in T63, no T65 were observed.
Despite the accumulation of T62 mRNA in transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing T64, no T65 were observed.
Despite the accumulation of T62 mRNA in T63, no abnormal T66 were observed.
Chen (2004) reported that T67 control transcriptional regulation of T68 expression.
That is, most T69 had normal T71 and only a fraction exhibited the T72 phenotype.
That is, most transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing T70 had normal T71 and only a fraction exhibited the T72 phenotype.
However, T73 demonstrated a more T76.
However, over-expression of T74 mutated at the target site of T75 demonstrated a more T76.
Accumulation of T77 protein was detected only in transgenic plants over-expressing mutated T77, not in normal T77.
Accumulation of T77 protein was detected only in T79 mutated T77, not in normal T77.
Accumulation of T77 protein was detected only in transgenic plants over-expressing mutated T77, not in normal T77.
Thus, we consider that accumulation of T83 mRNA in T84 is not sufficient to change T87 development.
Thus, we consider that accumulation of T82 in T84 is not sufficient to change T87 development.
Thus, we consider that accumulation of T83 mRNA in Arabidopsis over-expressing T85 is not sufficient to change T87 development.
Thus, we consider that accumulation of T83 mRNA in T84 is not sufficient to change T86.
This study has shown the mutual relationships between T88 and T89.
T90 and functional T91 affected the transcriptional regulation of T92.
T93 contributed slightly to T95 development, especially T97 development.
T93 contributed slightly to T94, especially T97 development.
T93 contributed slightly to T95 development, especially T96.
Future reports in this series will focus on the homeotic role of T98.
