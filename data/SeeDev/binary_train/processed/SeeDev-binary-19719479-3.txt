T1 directly enhances the expression of genes involved in T2 and T3 Factors controlling the overall level of oil stored in T4 of T5, and the integration of this biochemical process in the complex framework of T7 development, are only partially characterized (Santos Mendoza et al., 2008).

Complementary expression analyses and transcriptomic approaches have demonstrated that the T9fatty acids and T9 are largely regulated at the transcriptional level in T10 (Ruuska et al., 2002).

The ‘contrapuntal’ or differential timing of the expression of genes involved in T11 during T13 development most probably reflects distinct regulatory pathways controlling the transcription of different sets of genes involved in T14 and T15, respectively.

As groups of enzymes within a pathway sometimes exhibit similar regulation, it has been postulated that those members of a given pathway might share common cis- and trans-regulatory elements.
For instance, a number of genes encoding enzymes of the T16 and the T17 display a bell-shaped pattern of expression between 5 and 13 DAA (Ruuska et al., 2002).
This is corroborated in our study by qRT-PCR experiments aimed at characterizing the steady-state accumulation of T18 and PKp-β1 T19 among a T22 (Figure 3a) or T23 (Figure S1).

The T24 transcription factor, previously shown to represent a node in the regulatory network controlling T25 (Cernac and Benning, 2004), was proposed to trigger the transcription of the set of genes involved in the T26.
This hypothesis was based on the analysis of the expression profiles of putative target genes of T27 characterized in various T28 mutant backgrounds, and in tissues overexpressing T27 ectopically (Ruuska et al., 2002; Baud et al., 2007a).

In this study, the use of the T31 reporter gene, the expression of which is driven by full-length T32 of either T33 or T32, further establishes that T36 is able to strongly modulate the activity of these two promoters T37 (Figure 4a,b).

Finally, EMSA (Figure 8) and T38 experiments (Figure 7a) demonstrate that T39 is able to interact with the T41 promoter, strongly suggesting that this gene is a direct target of T39 T43.

It is noteworthy that the fine characterization of the changes in mRNA accumulation for T44, T45 and T46 throughout T48 development shows that the induction of the regulatory factor precedes the induction of its targets in the Col-0 accession (Figure 3).

This slight delay in the detection of mRNAs corresponding to target genes of T49 may presumably illustrate biochemical processes occurring in T50 cells, such as translation of the T49 peptide, and post-translational regulations (e.g. translocation of T49 towards the nucleus or putative recruitment of its interacting partners).
Whereas Cernac and Benning (2004) have reported that expression of T54 cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-promoter leads to slightly increased T55 T56, neither the Pro35Sdual:T54 nor the ProS2:T54 transgene used in the present study efficiently stimulates T59 in the corresponding transgenic T55s (Tables 1 and 2).
Whereas Cernac and Benning (2004) have reported that expression of T53 leads to slightly increased T55 T56, neither the T57 nor the T58 transgene used in the present study efficiently stimulates T59 in the corresponding transgenic T55s (Tables 1 and 2).

Several factors like growth conditions or strength and specificity of the different promoters used (classical T62 versus T62dual or T64) may explain these apparent discrepancies.
However, it is also interesting to note that the transgenes considered have been introduced in different T65 accessions (T66 versus Ws T66).

In the T68 (this study), the endogenous expression level of glycolytic and fatty acid biosynthetic genes is significantly higher than in the T69 (Figure S1).
Likewise, fatty acid concentration is more elevated in T70 of the T71 (see Figure 1c in Baud et al., 2007a).
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that expression of lipogenic genes may be more limiting in a T72 than in a T73.
