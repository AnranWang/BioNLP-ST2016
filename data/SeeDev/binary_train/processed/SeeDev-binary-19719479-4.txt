Functional dissections of the T1 and T4 T2 have led to the identification of enhancing regions of 54 and 79 bp, respectively, that are essential to direct the activity of these T2 in T6 of the T7.

Comparison of these enhancer elements using PLACE reveals the presence of shared nucleotide sequences that may constitute putative recognition sequences bound by the transcriptional machinery triggering T8.
The hexanucleotide T9 that can be observed on the minus strand of each enhancer element has previously been described as the core of the T10 (Allen et al., 1989).
This DNA binding factor was identified in T12 extracts from T13 soybean T13, and was initially presented as a positive regulator of transcription of the T15,T15 gene.
This DNA binding factor was identified in T11, and was initially presented as a positive regulator of transcription of the T15,T15 gene.
This DNA binding factor was identified in T12 extracts from T13 T14 seeds, and was initially presented as a positive regulator of transcription of the T15,T15 gene.
T16 activities were reported in T17 of other oleaginous species, such as T18 and T19 (Lessard et al., 1991).
In T20, T21 was shown to bind specifically to a site composed of two T22 elements separated by 27 bp (Allen et al., 1989).
Nevertheless, complementary studies then established that mutations abolishing the protein binding of this T23 factor T24 did not affect the T25 promoter activity in a significant manner (Fujiwara and Beachy, 1994).
Similarly, in this study, we show that mutations in the T26 element of the T28 promoter (m2; Figure 5b) do not impact on promoter activity (Figure 6).
Similarly, in this study, we show that mutations in the T26 element of the T27 (m2; Figure 5b) do not impact on promoter activity (Figure 6).
These results strongly suggest that isolated core T29 recognition sequences do not constitute essential cis-regulatory elements of the T30.
By carefully analysing the results of the functional dissections carried out on the enhancer regions of the T31 and PKp-β1 T32, it is possible to identify a DNA sequence highly conserved between the two T32 that is important for their activity (Figure 5).
