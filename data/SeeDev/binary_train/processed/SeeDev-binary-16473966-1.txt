T1 T2 (T3) is a T5 T6 (T8-T9) involved in the T10 and in T11.
T1 T2 (T3) is a T4 (T8-T9) involved in the T10 and in T11.
T1 T2 (T3) is a T5 T6 (T7) involved in the T10 and in T11.
To determine the composition of the T13 signaling complex T14, we generated T15 expressing the T13 protein fused to T17 under T13 promoter control.
To determine the composition of the T12 T14, we generated T15 expressing the T16 protein fused to T17 under T16 promoter control.
To determine the composition of the T13 signaling complex T14, we generated T15 expressing the T13 protein fused to T17 under T13 promoter control.
The membrane receptor complex was immunoprecipitated from T20, and the coimmunoprecipitating proteins were identified using liquid chromatography/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationâ€“time of flight/mass spectrometry of the trypsin-released peptides.
This approach identified two other T22-T23, the T24 (T25) receptor and its coreceptor, the T26 or T25-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 protein.
This approach identified two other T21, the T24 (T25) receptor and its coreceptor, the T26 or T25-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 protein.
This approach identified two other T22-T23, the T24 (T25) receptor and its coreceptor, the T26 or T25-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 protein.
In addition, T29, T30, and T31 were found.
Finally, the T32 T34-LIKE15 and an uncharacterized zinc finger protein, a member of the T35, were identified as part of the T36.
Finally, the T32 T33 and an uncharacterized zinc finger protein, a member of the T35, were identified as part of the T36.
Finally, the T32 T34-LIKE15 and an uncharacterized zinc finger protein, a member of the T35, were identified as part of the T37 complex.
Using blue native gel electrophoresis, we show that T38 and T39 are part of T40 with relative masses between 300 and 500 kD.
Using blue native gel electrophoresis, we show that T38 and T39 are part of T41-containing multiple protein complexes with relative masses between 300 and 500 kD.
The T43 mutant allele T44 enhances the phenotype of the weak T45 allele T46.
The T42 allele T44 enhances the phenotype of the weak T45 allele T46.
Collectively, these results suggest that apart from T47, T48 is also involved in the T49.
