Continuous T2 formation from the T3 during the T4 of T5 depends on the T6 in specific microenvironments, named T8 (Weigel and Jürgens, 2002; Laux, 2003).
Continuous T1 from the T3 during the T4 of T5 depends on the T6 in specific microenvironments, named T8 (Weigel and Jürgens, 2002; Laux, 2003).
Continuous T2 formation from the T3 during the T4 of T5 depends on the maintenance of undifferentiated T7 in specific microenvironments, named T8 (Weigel and Jürgens, 2002; Laux, 2003).
Here, we identify a novel regulatory pathway in T9 T10 defined by T11 function.
T12 Is Regulated by T13T13 was originally identified as a floral homeotic gene encoding T15 of T17 identity specification (Bowman et al., 1989, 1991).
T12 Is Regulated by T13T13 was originally identified as a floral homeotic gene encoding T15 of T16 (Bowman et al., 1989, 1991).
Recently, it has also been implicated in T18 and T19 (Okamuro et al., 1997b; Jofuku et al., 2005; Ohto et al., 2005).
Recently, it has also been implicated in T18 and control of T20 size (Okamuro et al., 1997b; Jofuku et al., 2005; Ohto et al., 2005).
Here, we show that T21 and T21/+ plants have a number of phenotypes in common with T23, such as T24, T25, and a T27.
Here, we show that T21 and T21/+ plants have a number of phenotypes in common with T23, such as T24, mispecified T26, and a T27.
Here, we show that T21 and T21/+ plants have a number of phenotypes in common with T23, such as T24, T25, and a reduction in T28 meristem size.
By contrast, T29 and T30 is only observed in the T31 allele.
T32 T33 is expressed in the T34 at all stages, consistent with an as yet unknown function there.
Our gene dosage experiments indicate that T35 T36 activity competes with T37 activity.
A plausible interpretation of these data is that T38 acts as a dominant-negative allele of T39 and thus identifies a novel pathway in T41 development.
A plausible interpretation of these data is that T38 acts as a dominant-negative allele of T39 and thus identifies a novel pathway in T40.
Definite proof of this model has to await the identification of potential redundant factors that appear to mask T42 function in the T43.
The T44 mutation changes a highly conserved negatively charged Glu residue into a positively charged Lys residue within the first of the two putative DNA binding domains of T45.
A possible model is therefore that the mutant protein competes with T46 T47 and redundant factor(s) for interactors in a protein complex but compromises its binding to DNA targets.
Alternatively, the mutant protein may still be able to bind to T48 target genes but fail to interact with cofactors required for transcriptional regulation.
Stochastic variations in the balance between mutant and redundant wild-type proteins might account for the differences when T50 termination occurs in individual homozygous T51 mutants.
Stochastic variations in the balance between mutant and redundant wild-type proteins might account for the differences when T49 occurs in individual homozygous T51 mutants.
