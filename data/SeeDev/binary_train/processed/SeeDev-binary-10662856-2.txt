Although small amounts of T1 protein might accumulate in these tissues throughout the T2, we conclude that the amounts of T3-localized T1 protein approach those seen in T5 only during the T6 in the T7 of T8.
With the onset of the T9, T11 promoter activity ceases in the T14 at the apex of the inflorescence.
With the onset of the T9, T10 activity ceases in the T14 at the apex of the inflorescence.
With the onset of the T9, T11 promoter activity ceases in the T13.
With the onset of the T9, T11 promoter activity ceases in the T14 at the T15.
This pattern of gene regulation further distinguishes T16 from the large group of T17, including T18 (Mandel et al. 1992b) and T19/T20 (Mandel and Yanofsky 1995a ; Gu et al. 1998), which are preferentially expressed during the T21 and are induced or upregulated during the T22 (Hempel et al. 1997).
In terms of regulation, T23 is most similar to the T24 gene T25, which encodes a repressor of T26 and is also downregulated in the transition to T26 (Michaels and Amasino 1999).
During the T28, T30 promoter activity is also associated with T31.
During the T28, T29 activity is also associated with T31.
T32 proceeds in the apical-to-basal direction in T33, as it does in T34 (reviewed in Telfer and Poethig 1994).
In both T35 and T36, which are considered homologous organs (reviewed in Poethig 1997), the T38 promoter is initially active throughout the T39 but is gradually restricted to the T41.
In both T35 and T36, which are considered homologous organs (reviewed in Poethig 1997), the T37 is initially active throughout the T39 but is gradually restricted to the T41.
In both T35 and T36, which are considered homologous organs (reviewed in Poethig 1997), the T38 promoter is initially active throughout the young organ T40 but is gradually restricted to the T41.
Given the patterns of T44 promoter activity and T43 and protein accumulation, we conclude that T44 function is most likely associated with the T46 and with T47 during the T48, when the protein concentrations are highest, and with T49 up to the point at which they are fully mature.
Given the patterns of T43 promoter activity and T43 and protein accumulation, we conclude that T43 function is most likely associated with the T46 and with T47 during the T48, when the protein concentrations are highest, and with T49 up to the point at which they are fully mature.
Given the patterns of T44 promoter activity and mRNA and protein accumulation, we conclude that T44 function is most likely associated with the T46 and with T47 during the T48, when the protein concentrations are highest, and with T49 up to the point at which they are fully mature.
To define more clearly any possible regulatory roles, we turned to an analysis of T50.
To define more clearly any possible regulatory roles, we turned to an analysis of transgenic plants that express T51 under the control of a heterologous promoter.
Effects of T53 Constitutive Expression We examined the effect of constitutive expression of T53 by generating transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying CaMV 35S promoter and T53 constructs.
Effects of T52 We examined the effect of T54 by generating T56 constructs.
Effects of T53 Constitutive Expression We examined the effect of constitutive expression of T53 by generating transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying CaMV 35S promoter and T53 constructs.
Effects of T53 Constitutive Expression We examined the effect of constitutive expression of T53 by generating transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying T57 and T53 constructs.
