T1 binds directly to and represses T2, T3 and T4 T5 It is becoming increasingly apparent that autoregulatory loops are a common phenomenon in the T6 in T8 (Gómez-Mena et al., 2005; Honma and Goto, 2000; Zhu and Perry, 2005).
T1 binds directly to and represses T2, T3 and T4 T5 It is becoming increasingly apparent that autoregulatory loops are a common phenomenon in the regulation of T7 in T8 (Gómez-Mena et al., 2005; Honma and Goto, 2000; Zhu and Perry, 2005).
We previously reported that T9 represses T9 transcription (Zhu and Perry, 2005).
T11 can also directly associate with T12 and repress accumulation of T15 transcript (Figure 5a,b).
T11 can also directly associate with regulatory regions of T13 and repress accumulation of T13 transcript (Figure 5a,b).
T11 can also directly associate with T12 and repress accumulation of T14 (Figure 5a,b).
No noticeable increase in T16 transcription has been observed in T17 (Figure 5b) or vice versa (unpublished data), but given that T19 is able to repress its own transcription (Zhu and Perry, 2005), and the close similarity and redundancy between T19 and T16 (Adamczyk et al., 2007), it is possible that any increase in expression is masked by a subsequent autorepression or higher levels of redundancy involving other T23 proteins.
No noticeable increase in T16 transcription has been observed in plants homozygous for null alleles of T18 (Figure 5b) or vice versa (unpublished data), but given that T18 is able to repress its own transcription (Zhu and Perry, 2005), and the close similarity and redundancy between T18 and T16 (Adamczyk et al., 2007), it is possible that any increase in expression is masked by a subsequent autorepression or higher levels of redundancy involving other T23 proteins.

T24 binds the T25 and represses its transcription.
T24 binds the promoter of T26 and represses its transcription.
There is an increase in T28 transcript accumulation in T29 plants, and, conversely, a decrease in response to increased T30 levels in all tissues tested.
There is an increase in T27 accumulation in T29 plants, and, conversely, a decrease in response to increased T30 levels in all tissues tested.
In contrast to what was observed in T31, no noticeable difference in T33 transcript between T34 and T35 T36 was observed, which could be result from genetic redundancy with other T37 expressed in the T38 but not present in the T39.
In contrast to what was observed in T31, no noticeable difference in T32 between T34 and T35 T36 was observed, which could be result from genetic redundancy with other T37 expressed in the T38 but not present in the T39.
There are numerous examples of genetic redundancy and complex regulatory interactions among T40 T41 (for a review, see Gutierrez-Cortines and Davies, 2000).
However, T42 is repressed, although not as drastically as in T43, in T45 constitutively expressing T46 relative to T47 plants, and is induced in T45 accumulating the T46-T52 fusion protein (Figure 5a).

The latter showed stronger GUS staining throughout the T62, whereas the former appeared to have less GUS activity relative to the uncrossed T64 control (K. Hill, unpublished data).

T65, T66 (Figure 5a) and other putative T67 downstream target genes (K. Hill, H. Wang and S.E. Perry, unpublished data), are not as highly induced by ectopic expression of T67-T70 as expected, especially when compared with levels of T72 transcript accumulation brought about by T67-T70 (Figure 5a).

It has been demonstrated that T76 and T77 perform at least partially redundant functions (Adamczyk et al., 2007, S. Perry, unpublished data), and given that T76-T80 induces accumulation of T77 transcript (Figure 5a), T77 might be subsequently repressing T84 and T85, and thus masking to some degree T76-T80-mediated transcription, although an increase in response to T76-T80 is still apparent.

T92 alone repressed T94 and T95 (Figure 5a), possibly through interaction with T96 that is expressed in T97 or through interaction with other DNA-binding proteins.
Ectopic expression of T93 alone repressed T94 and T95 (Figure 5a), possibly through interaction with T96 that is expressed in T97 or through interaction with other DNA-binding proteins.
However, T98 and T99 levels were unaffected by T100 alone, possibly indicating a more specific interaction at these loci.
