The T1 T2 (T3) gene is required for the T4 and the T7.
The T1 T2 (T3) gene is required for the specification of T5 and the T7.
The T1 T2 (T3) gene is required for the T4 and the completion of T8 maturation.
We isolated the T9 gene and showed that it functions at an T10 to T11.
The T12 gene encodes a transcription factor homolog, the T13.
The T12 gene encodes a transcription factor homolog, the T14 boxâ€“binding factor T15 subunit.
T17 RNA accumulates only during T18 in T20 and in T21.
T16 accumulates only during T18 in T20 and in T21.
T17 RNA accumulates only during T19 development in T20 and in T21.
T22 induces the expression of T25 and initiates T27.
Ectopic postembryonic expression of the T23 gene in T24 induces the expression of T25 and initiates T27.
T22 induces the expression of T26-specific genes and initiates formation of T26-like structures.
T22 induces the expression of T25 and initiates formation of T29-like structures.
Our results suggest that T30 is an important regulator of T31 that activates the transcription of T34 both T34 and T33.prs.rt("abs_end");
